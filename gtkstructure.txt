GTK (GIMP Toolkit) is structured as a set of libraries and APIs written in C. It follows an object-oriented design pattern using GObject, which is a type system used in GTK to manage objects and their behaviors. Here's a general overview of the structure of GTK:

Main Loop: At the heart of every GTK application lies a main loop. This loop continuously waits for events to happen (such as user input or system messages) and dispatches them to event handlers.

Widgets: GTK provides a wide range of widgets that you can use to build your user interface. These widgets include buttons, labels, text entries, windows, dialogs, and more. Widgets are the building blocks of a GTK application.

Containers: GTK provides container widgets that can hold other widgets. Examples include boxes, grids, notebooks, scrollable windows, and more. Containers help organize the layout of widgets within a window.

Events and Signals: Widgets emit signals when certain events occur, such as a button click or a window resize. GTK allows you to connect these signals to callback functions, which are functions in your code that get executed in response to the events.

Layout Management: GTK provides various layout managers that help you arrange widgets within a container. Layout managers determine how widgets are positioned and sized within their parent containers.

Drawing and Graphics: GTK provides facilities for drawing graphics and rendering text. You can use the Cairo graphics library to draw shapes, lines, and text on a GTK widget's surface.

Themes and Styling: GTK allows you to customize the appearance of your application using themes and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). You can use CSS to apply styles to individual widgets or to the entire application.

Internationalization and Localization: GTK supports internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) features, allowing you to create applications that support multiple languages and locales.

Accessibility: GTK includes built-in support for accessibility features, making it possible to create applications that are accessible to users with disabilities.
